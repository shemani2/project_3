# Description
This project utilizes Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Javascript to visualize COVID-19 vaccinations, hospitalizations, and cases reported in March 2021, March 2022, and March 2023. 

The analysis of vaccinations is informative for health promotion and to visualize the growth of the covid outbreak. It allows us to reflect on our experiences and how it shapes the healthcare field in the future. There was controversy around the validity and reliability of the vaccines, and we now have data to understand the concrete value of them. We can analyze the effectiveness of vaccines based on data availability.

By using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib we are analyzing COVID-19 from March 2021 to March 2023:
1.	Reported cases
2.	Hospitalizations
3.	Vaccinations
